# FinalProject


In order to make people care about what they eat, it needs to be personal. Heart disease is one of the most personal consequences because it is the leading cause of death in the US. This narrative can be leveraged to motivate people to consume less red meat, which is the most emissions-heavy type of animal product on the market. I want my interactive visualization to combine the user's heart health as well as the Earth's health: (h/eart)h/.

(h/eart)h/ will be a website which the user can enter their personal and dietary data to generate statistics like their carbon footprint, water footprint, risk of heart disease, and risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as additional data about the statistic that is revealed when hovered over those specific statistics. The goal of this visualization is to better connect people to the earth in a time that so desparately needs our undivided attention.

The current website statistics are in place for a meat-heavy diet.

16.4 metric tons of CO2:
  Derived from the average per capita cited by the World Bank. Assuming most people eat meat, this average CO2 statistic would be relevant.

25% risk of heart disease,
  According to the CDC, 1 out of every 4 Americans die of heart disease, so this puts the average American at a 25% risk. Assuming the average American also eats meat, this statistic correlates.

9% at risk of type 2 diabetes
  According to the CDC, 9% of Americans have type so diabetes, so this puts the average American at a 25% risk. Assuming the average American also eats meat, this statistic correlates.
